# WIC-Education-Website
What is this project?
-----
The WIC (Women, Infants, Children) social services program in Virginia requires participants to review educational material on a frequent basis. That current process involves accessing a Flash website and then printing a certificate that then must be delivered in-person to a social services office in order to receive the benefit. Given the number of people who rely solely on mobile web access, providing a website that is mobile friendly and a way to digitally sign and submit the certificate would be incredibly helpful to participants.The current website is HealthBitesVA.org.

Status
-----
Currently trying to understand the structure of the current website so that we can implement it in HTML. The website appears to be served via Flash templates (swf files) that read XML files to determine the displayed content. Check out the [current website](current-website/current-website.md) page for a description of the structure and XML break down. This project is still in very early stages with no actual code.
